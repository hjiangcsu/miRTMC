# miRTMC
miRNA target prediction based on matrix completion algorithm.

This project includes the dataset and excuteable programs (both on Windows and Linux platform) of the paper "miRTMC: A miRNA target prediction method based on matrix completion algorithm", which is submitted to the Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics.

Please see the readme.txt file in corresponding folder before you use the program. Make sure that the data files and the program are in the same folder, and the MATLAB Runtime version 9.0 (R2015b 64-bit) is installed on your computer.

This software package also available at http://bioinformatics.csu.edu.cn/resources/softs/jianghui/miRTMC/index.html

Note：Due to the sim_g.mat file in the data set D1 is relatively large, sim_g.mat is stored with Git LFS，please download it from data fold separately.
